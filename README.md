## Losing Streak Calculator

This module helps traders understand the potential losing streaks they might encounter based on their strategy's win rate and the number of trades they plan to make.

### Formula

The expected maximum losing streak is calculated using:

```
Expected Maximum Losing Streak â‰ˆ log(N) / log(1/(1-p))
```

Where:
- N is the sample size (number of trades)
- p is the win rate (as a decimal)
